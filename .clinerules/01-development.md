# Development

The development process should be agile and iterative and focus on very tight feedback loops.

Keep the context in mind. The context is the current state of the code, the desired state, and the results.

Focus on keeping it simple and small. When the context grows, suggest summarizing the context and starting a new iteration.

A new iteration would be a new conversation or thread between the agent and the developer.

## Loop

A loop focuses on observing the current state, orienting the code to the desired state, running the code, and observing the results.

### Observe

Observe the current state of the code. Read the code, understand the problem, and understand the desired state.

### Orient

Orient the code to the desired state. Write the code and tests to achieve the desired state.

### Run

Run the code. Executing the process and tests.

### Reflect

Reflect on the results of the code. Did the code achieve the desired state? Did it fail?

### Repeat

Repeat the process until the desired state is achieved. Avoid getting stuck in a loop.
If progress is blocked or there is uncertainty, explain the problem and ask for clarification.
