# Style

Use a consistent style throughout the project, including code formatting, naming conventions, and documentation.

Follow the existing convention and style used in the project. Style can be localized to specific files or sections of code.

It is acceptable to vary styles to avoid making too many changes at once.

Assume the style is enforced by a linter and formatter.

## Comments

Focus comments solely on explaining the code's functionality and design choices,
not the history of how the code was changed during our session.
Ensure final code does not contain comments related to the debugging steps or conversational edits.
