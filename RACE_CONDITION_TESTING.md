# Race Condition Testing Suite

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for verifying that the three major race condition bugs in the transfer workflow have been properly resolved.

## Overview of Race Conditions

The three race conditions that have been identified and fixed are:

1. **Bug 1: Notes Not Being Added** - Race condition between blockchain indexer and temporal workflow prevents notes from being attached to activities
2. **Bug 2: Duplicate Activities** - Multiple activity records appear for the same transfer due to timing issues in cleanup
3. **Bug 3: API Response Timing** - API waits for activity creation before responding, causing timeouts and user confusion

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. Database Integration Tests (`supabase/tests/race_condition_comprehensive_test.sql`)

**Purpose**: Verify SQL trigger fixes and database-level race condition handling

**Test Coverage** (25 tests total):

#### Bug 1: Note Lookup Tests (Tests 1-5)
- ✅ Primary lookup mechanism with event_id/event_name links
- ✅ Fallback lookup when blockchain indexer creates activities first
- ✅ Secondary fallback using user_op_hash extraction
- ✅ Prioritization of most recent records when multiple matches exist
- ✅ Support for both `send_account_transfers` and `send_account_receives` events

#### Bug 2: Duplicate Prevention Tests (Tests 6-8)  
- ✅ Proper temporal activity cleanup after confirmation
- ✅ Handling timing scenarios where blockchain activity appears first
- ✅ Edge case preservation of activities during processing

#### Bug 3: API Response Tests (Tests 9-10)
- ✅ Activity creation patterns supporting immediate API response
- ✅ Workflow state transitions from initialized to confirmed

#### Integration Tests (Tests 11-12)
- ✅ Complete race condition timeline simulation
- ✅ Multiple timing scenarios with fast/delayed cleanup

#### Error Scenarios (Tests 13-19)

- ✅ Safety checks (tx_hash required)
- ✅ Invalid event_id pattern rejection

#### End-to-End Tests (Tests 20-25)

### 4. Frontend Integration Tests (`packages/app/features/home/TokenActivityFeed.race-conditions.test.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Verify that the UI correctly handles all race condition scenarios

**Test Coverage**:

#### Bug 1: Note Display Tests
- ✅ Display notes found via primary lookup
- ✅ Display notes found via fallback lookup
- ✅ Graceful handling of activities without notes
- ✅ Note display for both send and receive activities

#### Bug 2: Duplicate Prevention Tests
- ✅ No duplicate display when cleanup works correctly

- ✅ Handling of temporary race condition state (both activities exist)
- ✅ Query invalidation on state changes

#### Bug 3: API Response Integration Tests
- ✅ Handle immediate workflow creation without waiting
- ✅ Appropriate loading states without long delays

#### Integration Tests
- ✅ Complete race condition scenario (5-step timeline)
- ✅ Consistent state during rapid updates

#### Error Recovery Tests
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Empty data handling
- ✅ Malformed data safety

## Race Condition Timeline Verification

The tests simulate the exact timing scenarios described in the race condition specifications:

### Bug 1 Timeline Test
1. **Time 1**: Temporal workflow starts
2. **Time 2**: Transaction submitted to blockchain
3. **Time 3**: Transaction confirmed on blockchain
4. **Time 4**: Blockchain indexer creates activity record (RACE POINT)
5. **Time 5**: Fallback lookup finds note via workflow_id pattern
6. **Time 6**: Temporal workflow updates with event IDs (too late for primary)
7. **Result**: Note successfully attached via fallback mechanism

### Bug 2 Timeline Test
1. **Time 1**: Temporal workflow creates temporal activity
2. **Time 2**: User sees "pending" transfer
3. **Time 3**: Transaction confirmed on blockchain
4. **Time 4**: Blockchain indexer creates blockchain activity (RACE POINT)
5. **Time 5**: Cleanup activity removes temporal record
6. **Time 6**: Final state has only one activity record

### Bug 3 Timeline Test
1. **Time 1**: User clicks SEND button
2. **Time 2**: API starts temporal workflow
3. **Time 3**: API returns immediately with workflow ID (FIX)
4. **Time 4**: User redirected to activity feed
5. **Time 5**: Workflow continues processing independently
6. **Result**: No waiting, no timeouts, immediate user feedback
