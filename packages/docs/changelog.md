## Migration to `buildSeo`

We have migrated to using the `buildSeo` function to enhance our SEO strategy across various pages. This change allows for more flexible and dynamic handling of SEO metadata. We recommend visiting [NextSeo documentation](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) for detailed integration guidelines and best practices.

### Reasoning

- **Scalability**: The `buildSeo` function provides a scalable solution for managing SEO metadata, allowing teams to modify SEO settings without impacting other functions.

- **Consistency**: Utilizing `buildSeo` ensures consistency across different parts of the application, avoiding SEO metadata discrepancies.

- **Efficiency**: Streamlined SEO management leads to a more efficient development process, reducing the need for repetitive manual updates.

Migrating to `buildSeo` aligns with our mission to keep our tech stack modern and maintainable, ultimately providing a better experience to both users and developers.
