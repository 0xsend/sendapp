# Send App Monorepo

Send is a next-generation payments app that makes sending, receiving, and earning money as seamless as texting. Enabling instant, global transfers and providing banking features for the digital age, Send is built for everyday users at the front, with blockchain at the back. Send combines the speed of modern digital payments with the security and transparency of blockchain—without the complexity.

We created Send because traditional banking infrastructure is no longer fit for the pace and expectations of today’s world. Between outdated rails, hidden fees, and custodial control, users are left with slow transactions, hidden costs, and little say in how their money is handled. For the 1.4 billion unbanked individuals globally, these systems aren’t just slow—they’re inaccessible.

Send offers an alternative: a user-first, non-custodial app where you stay in control of your funds. Using USDC, you can send money globally in seconds, with no intermediaries or banking hours in the way. Whether you're paying rent, splitting dinner, or sending funds overseas, Send makes it fast, reliable, and simple.
