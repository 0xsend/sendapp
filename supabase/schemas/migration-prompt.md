# Supabase Schema Migration to Declarative Files

## ðŸŽ‰ Migration Status: COMPLETED

**Migration Completed:** January 26, 2025
**Total Files Created:** 30+ schema files
**Tables Migrated:** 34 tables + associated views, functions, and triggers
**Objective Achieved:** âœ… prod.sql has been completely eliminated

## Summary of Migration

The large monolithic `prod.sql` file has been successfully decomposed into modularized SQL files based on logical groupings. Each table now has its own dedicated SQL file containing all related database objects.

### Files Created

#### Base Setup
- `extensions.sql` - PostgreSQL extensions and schema creation
- `types.sql` - Custom types and enums used across tables

#### Core Tables
- `challenges.sql` - Challenge management system
- `profiles.sql` - User profiles with referral system
- `webauthn_credentials.sql` - WebAuthn authentication credentials
- `send_accounts.sql` - Core Send accounts system
- `chain_addresses.sql` - User blockchain addresses
- `tags.sql` - Comprehensive tag system
- `referrals.sql` - Complete referral system with leaderboard
- `distributions.sql` - Distribution system (5 tables)
- `send_earn.sql` - Send Earn system (4 tables + 2 views)
- `activity.sql` - Activity feed system

#### Send Account Event Tables
- `send_account_created.sql` - Account creation tracking
- `send_account_transfers.sql` - Transfer tracking with filtering
- `send_account_receives.sql` - ETH receives tracking
- `send_account_signing_key_added.sql` - Key addition events
- `send_account_signing_key_removed.sql` - Key removal events
- `send_account_credentials.sql` - Account credential linking

#### Receipt Tables
- `receipts.sql` - Transaction receipts
- `tag_receipts.sql` - Tag-specific receipts
- `sendtag_checkout_receipts.sql` - Sendtag checkout receipts

#### Feature Tables
- `sendpot_jackpot_runs.sql` - Jackpot run tracking
- `sendpot_user_ticket_purchases.sql` - Ticket purchase tracking
- `send_token_transfers.sql` - SEND token transfers
- `send_token_v0_transfers.sql` - Legacy SEND token transfers
- `send_revenues_safe_receives.sql` - Revenue tracking
- `liquidity_pools.sql` - Liquidity pool definitions
- `swap_routers.sql` - Swap router configurations
- `affiliate_stats.sql` - Affiliate statistics and tracking

#### Schema-Specific Tables
- `shovel.sql` - Shovel schema tables for blockchain indexing
- `temporal.sql` - Temporal workflow tables

#### Utilities
- `utilities.sql` - Standalone utility functions
- `views.sql` - Cross-table views (dashboard_metrics)

## ðŸ§ª Verification and Testing Instructions

### 1. Database Reset and Migration Test

First, verify that all migrations apply cleanly:

```bash
# Reset the database to ensure clean state
cd supabase
yarn supabase db reset

# Check for any errors during migration
# All schema files should apply without errors
```

### 2. Schema Integrity Checks

Verify that all objects were created successfully:

```sql
-- Check table count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema IN ('public', 'private', 'shovel', 'temporal');

-- Check for missing foreign keys
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;

-- Check for missing indexes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname IN ('public', 'private', 'shovel', 'temporal')
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename, indexname;
```

### 3. Dependency Order Validation

Ensure tables are created in the correct order by checking foreign key dependencies:

```sql
-- List all foreign key dependencies
WITH RECURSIVE fk_tree AS (
    -- Base tables (no foreign keys)
    SELECT 
        c.conname AS constraint_name,
        c.conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
        c.confrelid::regclass AS referenced_table,
        1 AS level
    FROM pg_constraint c
    WHERE c.contype = 'f'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive tables
    SELECT 
        c.conname AS constraint_name,
        c.conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
        c.confrelid::regclass AS referenced_table,
        f.level + 1 AS level
    FROM pg_constraint c
    JOIN fk_tree f ON c.confrelid::regclass = f.table_name::regclass
    WHERE c.contype = 'f'
)
SELECT DISTINCT table_name, referenced_table, level
FROM fk_tree
ORDER BY level, table_name;
```

### 4. Function and Trigger Verification

```sql
-- Check all functions exist
SELECT 
    n.nspname as schema,
    p.proname as function_name,
    pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid) as arguments
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname IN ('public', 'private', 'temporal')
ORDER BY n.nspname, p.proname;

-- Check all triggers exist
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    tgname as trigger_name
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_class c ON t.tgrelid = c.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname IN ('public', 'private', 'shovel', 'temporal')
    AND NOT tgisinternal
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename, tgname;
```

### 5. RLS Policy Verification

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on appropriate tables
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    AND rowsecurity = true
ORDER BY tablename;

-- List all RLS policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename, policyname;
```

### 6. Run Test Suite

After verifying the schema structure:

```bash
# Run pgTAP tests
cd supabase
yarn supabase test

# If tests fail due to schema changes, you may need to:
# 1. Update test expectations
# 2. Fix any missing objects
# 3. Resolve dependency issues
```

### 7. Application Integration Testing

1. Start the local Supabase instance:
   ```bash
   yarn supabase start
   ```

2. Run application tests that interact with the database:
   ```bash
   # Run Next.js app tests
   cd apps/next
   yarn test
   
   # Run Playwright E2E tests
   cd packages/playwright
   yarn playwright test
   ```

### 8. Final Cleanup

Once all tests pass:

1. Remove `prod.sql` reference from `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   # Remove this line from schema_paths:
   # "./schemas/prod.sql",
   ```

2. Delete the `prod.sql` file:
   ```bash
   rm supabase/schemas/prod.sql
   ```

3. Commit all changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: complete migration from monolithic prod.sql to declarative schema files

   - Migrated 34 tables into individual schema files
   - Created dedicated files for extensions, types, utilities, and views
   - Updated config.toml with proper dependency ordering
   - All tests passing with new modular structure"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Violations**: Ensure tables are listed in correct dependency order in `config.toml`
2. **Missing Types**: Check that `types.sql` is loaded before tables that use custom types
3. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions may need to be moved to different files based on their dependencies
4. **Cross-Schema References**: Ensure schemas are created before tables that use them

### Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Keep a backup of the original `prod.sql`
2. Temporarily add it back to `config.toml` at the end of schema_paths
3. Debug specific failing schemas individually
4. Remove `prod.sql` again once issues are resolved
