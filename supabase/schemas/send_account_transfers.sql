-- Send Account Transfers
-- This table tracks transfers between send accounts on the blockchain

-- Functions

-- Filter function to ensure transfers only include existing send accounts
-- create trigger function for filtering send_account_transfers with no send_account_created
-- Deletes send_account_transfers with no send_account_created.
-- This is due to performance issues in our shovel indexer and using filter_ref to limit indexing to only
-- send_account_transfers with send_account_created.
-- For now, we index all USDC and SEND token transfers, and use this function filter any send_account_transfers with no send_account_created.
-- See https://github.com/orgs/indexsupply/discussions/268
