# Expo App Feature Parity Plan

## Goal

This document outlines the plan to bring the Expo application (`apps/expo`) to feature parity with the Next.js application (`apps/next`) in terms of page structure and navigation. We will leverage Expo Router's file-based routing and utilize shared components from `packages/app` where possible, adapting the UI for a mobile experience using Tamagui.

## 1. Next.js Page Structure (`apps/next/pages`)

The current structure of the Next.js application includes the following top-level pages and directories:

**Files:**

*   `_app.tsx` (App wrapper)
*   `_document.tsx` (Document structure)
*   `[tag].tsx` (Dynamic route for tags)
*   `404.tsx` (Not Found page)
*   `activity.tsx`
*   `index.tsx` (Home page)
*   `leaderboard.tsx`
*   `secret-shop.tsx`

**Directories:**

*   `account/`
*   `api/` (API routes - not relevant for Expo UI)
*   `auth/`
*   `deposit/`
*   `earn/`
*   `explore/`
*   `feed/`
*   `invest/`
*   `profile/` (Contains dynamic route `[sendid].tsx`)
*   `send/`
*   `sendpot/`
*   `trade/`

## 2. Current Expo App Structure (`apps/expo/app`)

The current structure is minimal:

**Files:**

*   `_layout.tsx` (Root layout)
*   `index.tsx` (Home screen)

**Directories:**

*   `(auth)/` (Authentication flow with `_layout.tsx`)

## 3. Authentication Flow Implementation

The app uses a non-traditional authentication approach:

* **Passkey Authentication**: If a user already has an account, they authenticate using passkeys (WebAuthn) rather than username/password
* **Sign Up Flow**: New users are redirected to the sign-up process
* **Home Page Implementation**: The Next.js `index.tsx` demonstrates this flow:
  * Checks for user session
  * If authenticated: Renders `HomeLayout` with `HomeScreen`
  * If not authenticated: Renders `SplashScreen` with `AuthCarouselContext` for onboarding carousel

**Implementation Notes:**
* The Expo app already has a `(auth)/_layout.tsx` with `AuthCarouselContext` structure in place
* When implementing authentication in Expo:
  * Review `apps/next/pages/index.tsx` for flow logic
  * Examine `packages/app/features/splash/screen.tsx` for the unauthenticated experience
  * Implement similar passkey authentication and sign-up redirects
  * Ensure carousel images and progress state are properly managed (the Next.js implementation loads these from server-side props)

## 4. Proposed Expo App Structure & Implementation Plan

We will use Expo Router's file-based routing conventions. Directories correspond to route segments, and files like `index.tsx` serve as the default screen for a directory. `_layout.tsx` files configure layout wrappers (e.g., Stack, Tabs).

**Implementation Approach:**
* For each screen implementation, first review the corresponding Next.js page to understand:
  * Component structure and imports
  * Authentication/protection logic
  * Data fetching patterns
  * UI layout and specific components

**Mapping:**

**Notes:**

*   **Shared Components:** Shared screen components are located in `packages/app/features/*`. If a required component doesn't exist, it needs to be created or adapted.
*   **Next.js Page Review:** For each screen implementation, carefully review the corresponding Next.js page to understand authentication requirements, data fetching patterns, and UI components in use.
*   **Authentication Implementation:** Implement the non-traditional auth flow using passkeys for existing users and redirect to sign-up for new users, mirroring the pattern in `apps/next/pages/index.tsx`.
*   **Navigation:** Use `solito`'s `<Link>` component and `useRouter` hook for cross-platform navigation between screens, leveraging Expo Router's file structure. Stack navigation will likely be the default via `_layout.tsx` files. Consider Tab navigation for top-level sections if appropriate for mobile UX.
*   **Authentication:** Implement authentication checks within the relevant `_layout.tsx` files (e.g., the root layout or a specific group layout) to protect routes. Redirect unauthenticated users to the `(auth)` group.
*   **Styling:** Utilize Tamagui components (`@tamagui/core`, `tamagui`) for UI elements consistent with the design system.

## 5. Next Steps and Progress

### Completed
1. âœ… Authentication flow implementation:
   - Updated home page implementation in `apps/expo/app/index.tsx` with session checking and conditional rendering similar to Next.js
   - Implemented the sign-in and sign-up screens in `apps/expo/app/(auth)/`
   - Set up the auth carousel for new users including image loading
   - Configured the AuthCarouselContext properly in both root index and auth layout

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Ensure `solito` is correctly configured in both `apps/next` and `apps/expo`.
2. Complete the directory structure within `apps/expo/app` as outlined above.
3. Create the basic `.tsx` files for each screen.
4. For each screen implementation:
   - Review the corresponding Next.js page implementation
   - Understand the data fetching patterns and UI components used
   - Import and render the corresponding shared screen components from `packages/app`
   - Adapt as needed for the mobile experience
5. Implement navigation between screens using `solito`'s `<Link>` component and `useRouter` hook.
6. Set up `_layout.tsx` files for Stack navigation within each main section (account, earn, etc.), potentially considering Tab navigation for the root layout.

### Specific Next Screen Priorities
1. Activity screen
2. Leaderboard screen
3. Profile screen
4. Deposit flow
5. Earn screens
