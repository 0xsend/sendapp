# Native App Implementation Plan

## Goal

Complete the Send native app implementation by addressing layout issues, improving user experience, and porting remaining features from the Next.js application.

## Current Navigation Architecture

The current navigation architecture for the Expo app is built using Expo Router v3 and follows a nested structure:

1. **Root Layout** (`/app/_layout.tsx`):
   - Sets up the Provider, theme loading, and authentication state
   - Configures the main Stack Navigator with screens for:
     - `index` (splash/login screen)
     - `(drawer)` (authenticated content)
     - `(auth)` (authentication flows)
     - `settings/index` (settings screen)

2. **Authentication Flow** (`/app/(auth)/`):
   - Contained in route group `(auth)`
   - Includes screens for sign-up, login-with-phone, and onboarding
   - Uses a Stack navigator for navigation between auth screens
   - Implements a shared AuthLayout component for consistent UI across auth screens

3. **Main App Flow** (`/app/(drawer)/`):
   - Protected by authentication check
   - Uses Drawer Navigator from `expo-router/drawer`
   - Custom drawer content with profile info and menu items

4. **Tab Navigation** (`/app/(drawer)/(tabs)/`):
   - Nested inside the drawer navigator
   - Currently includes: index (home), activity, profile, and earn tabs
   - Custom header with drawer menu toggle and "+" button

## Current Implementation Status

The Expo app has implemented several key components:

1. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Drawer navigation is complete with ALL menu items:
     - Home, Activity, Send, Deposit, Earn, Trade, SendPot, Explore, Invest, Feed, Leaderboard, Settings
   - Tab navigation includes Home, Activity, Profile, and Earn

2. **Screens Implemented**:
   - Complete authentication flow (sign-up, login-with-phone, and onboarding)
   - Reusable AuthLayout component for consistent styling across auth screens
   - Consistent screen headers with configureScreenHeader utility
   - Home screen with optimized HomeQuickActions and TokenActivityFeed
   - Send flow with confirmation screen
   - Simple activity, profile, and earn screens

3. **Missing Features**:
